# Decision-Trees
Implementation of Naive Bayes classifier from scratch

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the **Decision Tree algorithm** built from scratch using Python, without relying on `scikit-learn`. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of how decision trees work by implementing key components such as information gain, entropy, and tree splitting.

## Features
- Implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** from scratch
- Uses **Gini Impurity** for splitting criteria
- Handles both **categorical and numerical data**
- Supports **pruning** to prevent overfitting
- Includes **example dataset & usage guide**

## Installation
To use this implementation, you need Python 3.x installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Algorithm Explanation
1. **Calculate Impurity (Gini Index)**
2. **Find Best Split (Feature & Threshold)**
3. **Recursively Split Data** to form the tree
4. **Make Predictions** based on tree traversal

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the implementation!
